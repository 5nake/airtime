/**
 *  A class to play audio files and SMIL files through the Helix
 *  Community Library.
 *  This class can be configured with the following XML element.
 *
 *  <pre><code>
 *  <helixPlayer dllPath     = "../../usr/lib/helix"
 *               audioDevice = "/dev/sound/dsp"
 *  />
 *  <pre><code>
 *
 *  where the dllPath is the path to the directory containing the Helix
 *  library shared objects.  The optional audioDevice argument sets the
 *  AUDIO environment variable which is read by the Helix client.
 *
 *  There are two parameters which are only there because the current version
 *  of the Helix client does not handle animation tags in SMIL files properly.
 *  They will be removed from later versions.
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>audioStreamTimeOut (milliseconds) - the time to wait for each
 *          GetAudioStream() operation before a timeout occurs; 
 *          the default is 5;</li>
 *      <li>fadeLookAheadTime  (milliseconds) - each fade-in or fade-out is
 *          scheduled (using IHXAudioCrossFade::CrossFade()) this
 *          much time before it is to happen; the default is 2500. </li>
 *  </ul>
 *  
 *  The DTD for the above configuration is the following:
 *
 *  <pre><code>
 *  <!ELEMENT helixPlayer   EMPTY >
 *  <!ATTLIST helixPlayer   dllPath      CDATA   #REQUIRED >
 *  <!ATTLIST helixPlayer   audioDevice  CDATA   #IMPLIED  >
