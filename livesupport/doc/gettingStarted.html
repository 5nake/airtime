<h1>Scope</h1>
This document describes how to set up the LiveSupport development
environment.<br>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
LiveSupport uses a well-defined <a
 href="developmentEnvironment/index.html">development environment</a>.
Most of the LiveSupport-specific files are included in the version
control system, but some preparation and setup has to be made on system
used to develop LiveSupport as well.<br>
<h1>Steps<br>
</h1>
The following steps needed to be taken for setting up the LiveSupport
development environment.<br>
<ul>
  <li>install development tools<br>
  </li>
  <li>set up additional system resources</li>
  <li>check out the sources</li>
  <li>set up tools used by LiveSupport</li>
</ul>
<h2>Install development tools</h2>
Install all the tools needed for the development of LiveSupport. Please
see the <a href="developmentTools.html">development tools</a> document
for a list of tools needed.<br>
<h2>Set up additional system resources</h2>
The LiveSupport development environment uses some system resources,
that are not reasonable to include in the environment itself. One such
resource is an ODBC datasource to a test database. This
database has to be accessible for executing the test suites and
applications within the LiveSupport development environment.<br>
<br>
First, LiveSupport expects a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
database, and an ODBC
Data Source accessible to it through <a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">unixODBC</a>.
Please refer to the documentation of these tools to set them up.<br>
<br>
LiveSupport expects an ODBC Data Source with the following parameters:<br>
<ul>
  <li>DSN: <code>LiveSupport-test</code></li>
  <li>username: <code>test</code></li>
  <li>password: <code>test</code></li>
</ul>
This data source should point to a PostgreSQL instance. Only one
developer at the time should access this datasource, as the test suites
regularly create and destroy database tables.<br>
<br>
Second, LiveSupport expects:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> httpd server
running on the development computer</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> interpreter</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> apache module</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> support in PHP</li>
  <li><a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>
    modules: DB, XML_Util, XML_Beautifier, HTML_Common, HTML_QuickForm
    <br>
    (may be checked: <code>pear list</code> and installed by e.g.:
    <code>pear install DB</code>)</li>

<!--  <li><a href="http:///"></a></li>-->
</ul>
Please, check settings in <code>var/conf.php</code> files in both
storageServer and archiveServer modules and create two
symlinks with name corresponding to 'URL configuration' part of
<code>var/conf.php</code> files - example for default values:
<ul>
  <li> <code>http://localhost:80/livesupportStorageServer/</code>
should point to the <code>&lt;livesupport-cvs&gt;/modules/storageServer/var</code>
directory </li>
  <li> <code>http://localhost:80/livesupportArchiveServer/</code>
should point to the <code>&lt;livesupport-cvs&gt;/modules/archiveServer/var</code>
directory </li>
</ul>
<h2>Check out the sources</h2>
The LiveSupport development directory tree can be accessed via
anonymous <a href="https://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>, using the
CVSROOT <code>:pserver:anonymous@netfinity-5.mdlf.org:/home/cvs</code>.
The repository is called livesupport, thus the following CVS command
would check out the development tree:<br>
<pre><code><br>cvs -z3 -d </code><code>:pserver:anonymous@netfinity-5.mdlf.org:/home/cvs checkout livesupport<br><br></code></pre>
This will check out and create the LiveSupport development <a
 href="developmentEnvironment/directoryStructure.html">directory
structure</a>.<br>
<h2>Set up tools</h2>
LiveSupport uses widely available tools for development, like the GNU
C++ compiler, but also uses more specific tools. As these tools, or the
exact versions of these tools are not expected to be installed on the
development system, the LiveSupport development environment contains
them. The tools are installed into the <code>livesupport/usr</code>
directory, as described in the directory structure document.<br>
<br>
Moreover, some components in livesupport have to be set up prior to
compilation, for example running autoconf or similar configuration
programs. This ensures that the components compile fine on the
development system.<br>
<br>
To achieve all these goals, invoke the target <code>setup</code> in
the main <code>Makefile</code>, at the root of the LiveSupport
directory structure, by issuing the following command in the
livesupport directory:<br>
<pre><code><br>cd livesupport<br>make setup<br><br></code></pre>
The execution of this command will take a while, as all the supporting
libraries and tools are compiled and installed to the <code>livesupport/usr</code>
directory. Please note that nothing is installed outside of the
LiveSupport directory structure.<br>
<h1>Ready to roll</h1>
With the above steps completed, the LiveSupport modules and products
are ready to be compiled and developed further. Have fun!<br>
