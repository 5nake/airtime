The HTTP_GROUP variable in Makefile haveto be set to group running apache.

Install steps for file uploading (do it with appropriate changes):
(PUT method for uploading from behind firewall with resume feature)

1) mkdir cgi-bin-put in apache2 dir
2) move put.cgi there from var subdir
3) add to apache2 config (i.g. commonapache2.conf):

<Location /livesupport/modules/archiveServer/var/access>
  Script PUT /cgi-bin-put/put.cgi
</Location>
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin-put/ "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin-put/"
<Directory /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin-put>
    AllowOverride All
    Options ExecCGI
    <IfModule mod_access.c>
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </IfModule>
</Directory>

4) reload apache2

Tested with apache 2.0.49 and (without Directory tag) with apache 1.3.28.

TODO: check more put.cgi for security problems!
